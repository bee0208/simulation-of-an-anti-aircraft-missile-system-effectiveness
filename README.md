# simulation-of-an-anti-aircraft-missile-system-effectiveness

## Introduction 
The project presents the results of the development of an application for testing the effectiveness of the anti-aircraft system. The application was developed with Matlab App Designer and is based on a simulation model developed in Matlab&Simulink software. It was created for repeated research of the anti-aircraft system in a clear interface. This will allow you to quickly change the initial shooting conditions and analyze the data in one window. Matlab ver. 2020b was used.

## APP
The application interface is divided into two main parts: the input data panel (left side) and the shooting simulation summary panel (right side).
